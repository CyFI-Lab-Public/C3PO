*Coming soon*

## Foreword
Before working with C3PO please make sure to read the 
[C3PO paper](https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu/publications/) 
as it will help with understanding and extending the tool it if necessary!
Keep in mind that this tool is still not perfect, errors are not uncommon and knowing how to work with angr is essential.

This code is provided as is. If you extend it in any way/fix any bugs, then please reach out. We will be glad to incorporate any upgrades and give you due credit! :)
